summary: Impressions and lessons from my first capture the flag
---

Last week I participated in the [Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2021][htb-ca-2021]. It was
my first ever Capture the flag and I had fun and learned a bunch.

## First impressions

Since I never did a CTF I was a bit overwhelmed by what the hell I should do.

Thankfully the organizers helped a bunch by making the first flag one needed to
get, one which could be found on the HackTheBox discord.

This also had the nice side effect of giving me a platform to ask questions if I
had any :+1:
