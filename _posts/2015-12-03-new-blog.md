After what feels like 500 tries I finally found a blog software + server combination which I am willing to use.

As I am writing this post on my Win7 machine with [MarkdownPad 2][markdownpad2] my Centos server is running an instance of the [gatling][gatling] webserver developed by [fefe][fefe].

And for content formatting I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll].

Read my [follow-up post][install] how I set this up.
